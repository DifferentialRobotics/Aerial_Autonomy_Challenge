# 2025 Aerial Autonomy Challenge 
# 2025 IROS COMPETITION

## Official Test Environment
> ros-noetic  
> ubuntu20.04  
> NVIDIA RTX4060
> INTEL I7

## Quick Start
#### Build and Launch Simulator-bridge
>+ `cd /path/to/AerialAutonomyChallenge-Simulator-bridge`  
>+ `catkin_make`
>+ `source devel/setup.bash`
>+ `roslaunch ros_tcp_endpoint endpoint.launch`

#### Launch Simulator
>+ `cd /path/to/AerialAutonomyChallenge-Simulator`  
>+ Double-click`AerialAutonomyChallenge-Simulator.x86_64`inside the simulator folder

#### Build and Launch Demo Code
>+ `cd /path/to/AerialAutonomyChallenge-Demo-EgoPlannerv2`  
>+ `catkin_make`
>+ `source devel/setup.bash`
>+ `roslaunch ego_planner single_drone_interactive.launch`

## UI Interaction
>+ Use W/A/S/D to move the camera horizontally
>+ Left mouse button controls camera pitch, right button controls yaw; both buttons can be held together
>+ Hold and drag the middle mouse button to move the camera similarly to W/A/S/D
>+ Current movement speeds in simulator: 0.35 m/s, 0.35 m/s, 0.2 m/s
